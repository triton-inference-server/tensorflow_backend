# TensorFlow Backend

The Triton backend for TensorFlow.

Use a recent cmake to build and install in a local directory.

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=`pwd`/install ..
$ make install
```

The following required Triton repositories will be pulled and used in
the build. By default the "main" branch/tag will be used for each repo
but the listed CMake argument can be used to override.

* triton-inference-server/backend: -DTRITON_BACKEND_REPO_TAG=[tag]
* triton-inference-server/core: -DTRITON_CORE_REPO_TAG=[tag]
* triton-inference-server/common: -DTRITON_COMMON_REPO_TAG=[tag]
